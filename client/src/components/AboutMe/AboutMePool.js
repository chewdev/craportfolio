        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Chris, a full-stack web developer living
          in Los Angeles, CA. Having graduated with a degree in Mechanical
          Engineering, I have always enjoyed solving difficult technical
          challenges. Designing and building is my passion, making your life
          easier is my goal.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm not busy studying web development,
          I'm tinkering with Arduino and IoT. Outside of tech, I love sports,
          especially baseball (Let's Go Dodgers!), and traveling.
